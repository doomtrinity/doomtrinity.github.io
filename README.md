## My work on games
I write game code, but I also deal with other side tasks, especially first-person model animations.  
Some projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

### [Retchid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1419060/Retchid/)
FPS inspired by the combat pacing of Doom '94 and the looks of Doom 3, using Unreal Engine 4.  

### [Arx: End of Sun](https://www.moddb.com/mods/arx-end-of-sun)
Free game based on the first person dungeon RPG: Arx Fatalis, developed by Arkane Studios.  
Total conversion based on the idTech4 (Doom 3) engine.

### [Perfected Doom 3](https://www.moddb.com/mods/perfected-doom-3-version-500)
Doom 3 mod that brings many improvements to vanilla Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil expansion.

### [doomtrinity's FPS prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkWZRlPL54c)
A very simple project I made to learn the basics of the Unity3D gameplay framework.

### Other projects/mods and unreleased work
Mostly Doom 3 stuff. Unfortunately, some projects never saw the light of day.

## Other work as programmer
2016/2019 - Backend web developer (web server programming and administration).
